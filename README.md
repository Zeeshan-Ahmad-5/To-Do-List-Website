## HOW IT WORKS

- Users enter a task and click **"Add Task"** or press **Enter**
- Task is added to a list with:
  - A **checkbox** to toggle completion (`line-through` style)
  - An **Edit button** that prompts the user to modify the task
  - A **Delete button** to remove the task instantly
- Task input is cleared after submission
- Scrollbars are styled to match the theme
- All interactivity is handled through pure JavaScript

---

## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

- Save tasks in **localStorage** for persistence across refresh  
- Add task **priority levels** (high, medium, low)  
- Implement **drag-and-drop** sorting  
- Add **date & time** support  
- Add **filtering** (All / Completed / Pending)  
- Add **light mode toggle**
